Instance no: 2

Programming environment (operating system, programming languagae, IDE, ...):
I wrote with python 3 language with Pycharm IDE on MacOSX operating system. Also i used numpy and networkx library.



Description of approach used (max 200 words):
I tried to implement constraint programming approach. Firstly, i tried to find a node which has max number of neighbour and i gave it first color. After, for each iteration i choose another node which has max number of neighbour for the rest. For this node i’m checking all neihgbours if any of them coloured before. If coloured i delete the color from colors list and i gave a first available color to node. Moreover, i realise how much number of colors i gave to my algorithm, most of the time it uses all of them. So, i give the smallest number as possible. For this instance it is 17.




All relevant parameters and their settings:
To run my code, python 3.4.0 should’ve been installed also i used numpy library for arithmetic operations and used networkx for Graph operations.
color_number = 17
To install numpy write below code to terminal:
	pip install numpy
To install networkx
	pip install networkx
